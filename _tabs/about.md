This site is a personal portfolio and blogging page of me (Linus Eickhoff), where I will showcase some projects and write about my interests.

# About me

I am a grad student in computer science at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. My main focus in this field is **Data Science**, **Machine Learning** and **AI**.\
Apart from university, I am passionate about **Philosophy of Mind**, Theories of **Consciousness** and the **nature of reality**.\
To drop a few names, I strongly resonate with many ideas of **Joscha Bach** (Philosophy, Consciousness, AI), **Stephen Wolfram** (Wolfram Physics, Observer Theory) and **Michael Levin** (Self Organization, Cognitive Agents).

- The development of a **workload-analysis suite** at the [HLRS](https://www.hlrs.de/) in Stuttgart, featuring algorithms and visualizations to detect topologically-inefficient resource usage of jobs running on the supercomputer [HPE Apollo (HAWK)](https://www.hlrs.de/de/loesungen/systeme/hpe-apollo-hawk).

### SPIRITFAKTUR (Jul 2024 - now)

The startup [SPIRITFAKTUR](https://www.spiritfaktur.de/) is a small agency and investment fund, where I work on different projects, related to **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, in part-time.
