The RGB Version of the Bhuddabrot (Called [Nebulabrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhabrot)):

_An Image of the Nebulabrot rendered by coloring each pixel based on its number of visits for escaping c values of the mandelbrot series ($$ z_{n+1}=z_n^2 + c $$ where $$ c \in \mathbb{C} $$ and $$ Z_0=c $$) in a given number of iterations (e.g. 2000 for red, 200 for green and 20 for blue)_

## Random tests

This is how inline code looks like `print("Hello World")`. The following generates the sequence used to obtain the mandelbrot set (in set if seq is converging):

```python
def mandelbrot_seq(c, max):
  def seq(z_seq):
    if(len(z_seq)<max):
      z_seq.append(z[-1]^2+c)
    return seq(z_seq)

  return seq([c])
```
